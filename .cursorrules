# SmartDesk AI Rules & Context

You are an expert Python developer working on "SmartDesk", a Windows virtual desktop manager using PySide6 and Win32 APIs.

## 🧠 Core Principles
- **Stability First:** System-level calls (Win32) must be wrapped in try-except blocks. Crashes in background threads must not kill the main app.
- **Performance:** GUI operations (PySide6) must happen in the main thread. Heavy lifting (file I/O, system calls) goes to background threads.
- **Clean Code:** Follow PEP 8. Use type hints (`typing`) strictly. Docstrings for complex functions.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Features (v0.4.1+)
- **Persistent GUI Overlay:** 
  - The hotkey overview (`gui_overview.py`) runs as a persistent background process managed by `BannerController`.
  - Communication happens via `stdin` commands: `SHOW`, `HIDE`, `QUIT`.
  - **Do not** revert to spawning a new process per keypress.
- **Hotkey Logic:** 
  - Triggers are "On-Release" (key up) to prevent conflicts.
  - Supports an "Instant Mode" (0.0s delay) which bypasses timer threads entirely.
  - State Machine: `IDLE` -> `ARMED` -> `HOLDING` -> `SHOWING`.
- **Desktop Switching Workflow:** 
  - Sequence: Create Lock File -> Create Registry Backup -> Save Icons -> Update Registry -> Restart Windows Explorer -> Restore Icons/Wallpaper.
  - The fullscreen fade animation (`screen_fade.py`) is critical to hide the desktop flickering during this restart.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation Details
- **Threading & Locks:** 
  - Services requiring recursive internal calls (e.g., `add_rule` calling `save_rules`) **must** use `threading.RLock` instead of `threading.Lock` to avoid deadlocks.
  - When iterating over system resources based on a shared locked resource, make a copy of the resource within the lock, then release the lock before starting the long iteration.
- **Performance (psutil):** 
  - To check running processes against rules, iterate through `psutil.process_iter()` and check each process individually. Stop as soon as a match is found. Do not create a large set of all process names first.
  - For process termination checks, prefer `psutil.wait_procs` with a pre-filtered list over polling loops.
- **Environment:** 
  - Network access can be unreliable; avoid unnecessary `pip install` commands.

## 🧪 Testing & Development
- **Framework:** `pytest`. Run via `python -m pytest` to ensure correct environment.
- **Requirements:** 
  - Must set `PYTHONPATH=src` and provide the `APPDATA` environment variable.
  - **Mocking:** Since SmartDesk is Windows-heavy, mock `win32*`, `ctypes`, `PySide6`, `PIL`, and `pynput` in `tests/conftest.py` to allow execution in limited environments.

## 📝 Coding Style
- **Naming:**
  - Variables/Functions: `snake_case` (e.g., `current_desktop`)
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `DesktopService`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
- **File Structure:**
  - `core/`: Business logic & Services
  - `ui/`: PySide6 GUI & Tray
  - `hotkeys/`: pynput Listeners
  - `shared/`: Config & Logging
- **Logging:** 
  - Use `smartdesk.shared.logging_config.get_logger`. 
  - **Never** use `print()` in production code (it crashes in `.pyw` no-console mode).

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **GUI:** PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- **System:** pywin32 (ctypes, user32, shell32)
- **Input:** pynput (Global Hotkeys)

## 🚀 Release Process
- Update `__version__` in `src/smartdesk/__init__.py`.
- Create Git Tag (e.g., `v0.4.1`).
- Document changes in `docs/releases/vX.X.X.md`.
